# nh-ebl-pipeline

**Description:**

This is an image analysis pipeline used to measure extragalactic backgroundlight in New Horizons LORRI images. Images are first selected based on exposure time and astrometrically registered. Includes functions for various types of automated masking via imported star catalog, manual masking, coordinate conversions, and estimates of diffuse galactic light and integrated star light from telescope response and faint stars. Also includes miscellaneous plotting tools. 

**Dependencies:**

Much of the pipeline is written in Matlab, with a limited amount in Python and IDL. 

**Acknowledgements:**

Ongoing support from NASA via the New Frontiers Data Analysis Program is gratefully acknowledged.
