# Planck Cirrus Estimation
This is a program that is meant to simulate the Cirrus emission at a specified field using
parameters from fitting to the Planck GNILC-Dust-Maps in Planck 2015.

The maps have an offset from the fact that in Planck 2015 they correlated the fit for the Modified BlackBody with regions of H1.
